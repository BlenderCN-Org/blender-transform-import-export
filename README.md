Blender Transform Import/Export
===============================

Simple Blender add-on which makes it easy to export the translation, rotation, and scale of the selected object in the scene to a simple JSON format, and import it to be applied to the currently selected object.

I wanted to have it to be able to position models relative to one another in Blender and then easily get the transformation into JavaScript to use with WebGL.
